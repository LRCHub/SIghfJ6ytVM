(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
I don't see me
In your eyes anymore.
Oh, why can't I
Make them shine like before?

I don't see you
(I don't see you)
Or your heart in your kiss.
(Doo-doo-doo-do)
That you should say
(Ooooh)
That you're mine. You resist.
(You resist)

There was a time,
Life was fine,
Love was ecstasy.
But now I doubt,
What the outcome will be.

I pray you'll say,
I'm the one you adore.
Then I'll see me,
(I'll see me)
In your eyes as before.
(Aaaaah-aaah)

I pray you'll say,
I'm the one you adore.
Then I'll see me
(I'll see me)
In your eyes as before.
(I'll see me as before)
