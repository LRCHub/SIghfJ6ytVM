> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Some days are easier to fake it
I find it hard to think
when you're brought up
I know it takes a heart
to break it
(Yeah)
But you took that and some more
when you gave up
I get it, I get it, I get it,
I get it
Some things don't work
And that's the way love goes
I get it, I get it, I get it,
I get it
It's over now,
but time will tell
If you seek you will find
What was there the whole time
Was love in disguise,
in your eyes
If you seek you will find
What was there the whole time
Was love in disguise,
in your eyes
There in your eyes
(Wo)
There in your eyes
(I get it, I get it,
I get it yeah)
There in your eyes
(I get it, I get it, I get it,
yeah, whoa)
There in your eyes
(I get it, I get it, I get it,
yeah)
I needed you,
but you went missing
(Yeah)
Told me you'd change,
but you kept loosing touch
And somethings
I wouldn't even mention
Just know I don't need
your attention, no
I get it, I get it, I get it,
I get it
Some things don't work
And that's the way love goes
I get it, I get it, I get it,
I get it
It's over now,
but time will tell
If you seek you will find
What was there the whole time
Was love in disguise,
in your eyes
If you seek you will find
What was there the whole time
Was love in disguise,
in your eyes
There in your eyes
(Wo)
There in your eyes
(I get it, I get it, I get it,
yeah)
There in your eyes
(I get it, I get it, I get it,
yeah, wo)
There in your eyes
(I get it, I get it, I get it,
yeah)
If you seek you will find
What was there the whole time
Was love in disguise,
in your eyes
If you seek you will find
What was there the whole time
Was love in disguise,
in your eyes
